# VSplitFromSidebar

Very simple Sublime Text 3 package to add Sidebar options to open or clone files in a new vertical split.

## Installation

As this is a very simple package intended for personal use, I have not considered adding it into Package Control.

To install, copy this folder to your Sublime Text Packages directory. You can find the path of this folder from the menu *Preferences > Browse Packages...*.

You should see the new actions available from the sidebar after the folder has been moved there.
